<h6 class="ltx_title ltx_title_abstract">Abstract</h6>
<p class="ltx_p" id="id5.id1">Recent advances in multimodal imaging acquisition techniques have allowed us to measure different aspects of brain structure and function. Multimodal fusion, such as linked independent component analysis (LICA), is popularly used to integrate complementary information. However, it has suffered from missing data, commonly occurring in neuroimaging data. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a Full Information LICA algorithm (FI-LICA) to handle the missing data problem during multimodal fusion under the LICA framework. Built upon complete cases, our method employs the principle of full information and utilizes all available information to recover the missing latent information. Our simulation experiments showed the ideal performance of FI-LICA compared to current practices. Further, we applied FI-LICA to multimodal data from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study, showcasing better performance in classifying current diagnosis and in predicting the AD transition of participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), thereby highlighting the practical utility of our proposed method.</p>

<div class="ltx_para ltx_noindent" id="S1.p1">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S1.p1.1">Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is an irreversible neurodegenerative brain disorder that progressively compromises cognitive functioning and behavioral abilities <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Yu et al., <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2406.18829v1#bib.bib1" title="">2022</a>)</cite>. In AD studies, data from different imaging modalities, such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging, is typically collected to derive important biomarkers for disease diagnosis and progression.
To understand the cross-information from different modalities in a more unified way, it becomes increasingly necessary to analyze data from different modalities jointly <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Lahat et al., <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2406.18829v1#bib.bib2" title="">2015</a>; Calhoun and Sui, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2406.18829v1#bib.bib3" title="">2016</a>)</cite>, which introduces the concept of multimodal fusion.
However, such information integration is impeded by missing data, a common occurrence in neuroimaging data for various reasons including quality check failure, study design, or the absence of specific imaging sessions. Thus, handling missing data during the fusion of multiple modalities is not trivial in AD studies because of distinct causes and patterns of missing data.
Take as an illustrative example the data from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), a longitudinal multicenter study designed for the early detection and tracking of Alzheimer’s disease (Section <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2406.18829v1#S4" title="4 Data application ‣ Full Information Linked ICA: addressing missing data problem in multimodal fusion For the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc.edu). As such, the investigators within the ADNI contributed to the design and implementation of ADNI and/or provided data but did not participate in the analysis or writing of this report. A complete listing of ADNI investigators can be found at: http://adni.loni.usc.edu/wp-content/uploads/how_to_apply/ADNI_Acknowledgement_List.pdf"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>). Different imaging data was collected in the ADNI study, such as T1-weighted MRI, Florbetapir (AV45) PET imaging, and fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET imaging. There were 1291 subjects who had no missing T1 data but missing AV45 or FDG data at baseline. Figure <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2406.18829v1#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Full Information Linked ICA: addressing missing data problem in multimodal fusion For the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc.edu). As such, the investigators within the ADNI contributed to the design and implementation of ADNI and/or provided data but did not participate in the analysis or writing of this report. A complete listing of ADNI investigators can be found at: http://adni.loni.usc.edu/wp-content/uploads/how_to_apply/ADNI_Acknowledgement_List.pdf"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> displays the Venn diagram of the sample size within the three modalities. It can be observed that a considerable portion of data (24%) would be lost if only complete data across all three modalities were considered. The sample size would decrease further if more modalities were taken into consideration, given the complex data structure among modalities.
Therefore, it is important to properly address the missing data problem in multimodal fusion to ensure accurate and reliable results.</p>

However, LICA cannot handle missing data very well.
Currently, there are two ways to handle missing data in LICA. One is the complete case analysis (i.e., only analyzing data from subjects present in all modalities), and the other is the zero-filling method (i.e., replacing missing values with zeros before running LICA). Both of them have their own limitations. The effective sample size in the complete case analysis can drop dramatically when there is a large proportion of missing data, especially when the missing structure among modalities is complicated. As a result, the complete case analysis may discard important underlying information and lead to biased results. In addition, as the shared subject loadings are often of interest in LICA, one notable limitation of the complete case analysis is that the latent information is not available for the excluded subjects and cannot be recovered. Furthermore, the zero-filling method will make the LICA algorithm unstable and thus yield inaccurate estimations.</p>

Each of them has its own benefits and purposes, but the missing data problem still has not been well addressed. Commonly used methods to handle missingness in multimodal fusion include complete data analysis (e.g., in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">Simidjievski et al., <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2406.18829v1#bib.bib15" title="">2019</a>; Tong et al., <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2406.18829v1#bib.bib16" title="">2020</a>; Lu et al., <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2406.18829v1#bib.bib17" title="">2021</a>; Hira et al., <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2406.18829v1#bib.bib18" title="">2021</a></cite>), one-time filling for the missing data (e.g., mean-filling (in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">Xie et al., <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2406.18829v1#bib.bib19" title="">2019</a>; Zhang et al., <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2406.18829v1#bib.bib20" title="">2019</a></cite>), median-filling (in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">Guo et al., <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2406.18829v1#bib.bib21" title="">2020</a>; Chai et al., <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2406.18829v1#bib.bib22" title="">2021</a></cite>), zero-filling (in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">Zhang et al., <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2406.18829v1#bib.bib23" title="">2020</a>; Venugopalan et al., <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2406.18829v1#bib.bib24" title="">2021</a>; Vale-Silva and Rohr, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2406.18829v1#bib.bib25" title="">2021</a></cite>), filling based on nearest neighbors (in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">Chaudhary et al., <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2406.18829v1#bib.bib26" title="">2018</a>; Sun et al., <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2406.18829v1#bib.bib27" title="">2019</a>; Xu et al., <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2406.18829v1#bib.bib28" title="">2019</a>; Lv et al., <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2406.18829v1#bib.bib29" title="">2020</a>; Yu et al., <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2406.18829v1#bib.bib30" title="">2020</a>; Albaradei et al., <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2406.18829v1#bib.bib31" title="">2021</a></cite>)) with or without a pre-filtering step, and deep learning (e.g., in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">Cheerla and Gevaert, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2406.18829v1#bib.bib32" title="">2019</a>; Shen and Gao, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2406.18829v1#bib.bib33" title="">2019</a>; Sun et al., <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2406.18829v1#bib.bib34" title="">2021</a>; Tran et al., <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2406.18829v1#bib.bib35" title="">2017</a>; Zhou et al., <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2406.18829v1#bib.bib36" title="">2022</a></cite>).
The same limitation persists with complete data analysis as aforementioned in LICA that important information may be discarded and biased results may be obtained. One-time filling/imputation is prone to yield biased and inaccurate results. Although methods based on deep learning can computationally handle missingness, it is difficult to make inferences from these methods. Therefore, we would like to address the missing data problem in multimodal fusion and we will formulate our method in particular under the framework of LICA.</p>

<div class="ltx_para ltx_noindent" id="S1.p4">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S1.p4.1">In classical statistical analysis literature, multiple imputation (MI; <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Rubin (<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2406.18829v1#bib.bib37" title="">1987</a>)</cite>) or full information maximum likelihood (FIML; <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Anderson (<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2406.18829v1#bib.bib38" title="">1957</a>)</cite>) is commonly used to address the issue of missingness. However, under the context of multimodal fusion, it is not straightforward how MI can be implemented. MI can be viewed as a three-step process – i) generating several imputed datasets (by imputing missing values in one data using the other available data), ii) performing the target analysis on each of the imputed datasets, and iii) pooling results together to obtain the final results. Under the LICA framework, when the missing data in one modality is imputed using the other modalities in step i), unwanted correlation may be imposed between modalities. This in turn may affect the fusing results in step ii). Further, since the order of the estimated independent components from LICA is random, it is not straightforward how the results can be aggregated in step iii). As such, to address the missing data problem in LICA, one of the plausible ways currently is to use the FIML.
Therefore, in this paper, we utilized the principle of full information and proposed the Full Information Linked ICA algorithm (FI-LICA) to handle the missing data problem in multimodal fusion under the LICA framework.</p>

The number of independent components is typically determined based on the study of interest, and a large iteration number is usually expected so that the estimation converges (dF <math alttext="&lt;" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" id="S2.p11.1.m1.1"><semantics id="S2.p11.1.m1.1a"><mo id="S2.p11.1.m1.1.1" xref="S2.p11.1.m1.1.1.cmml">&lt;</mo><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S2.p11.1.m1.1b"><lt id="S2.p11.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S2.p11.1.m1.1.1"></lt></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S2.p11.1.m1.1c">&lt;</annotation><annotation encoding="application/x-llamapun" id="S2.p11.1.m1.1d">&lt;</annotation></semantics></math> 0.1).

For FI-LICA, a combination of 1000 LICA iterations and 20 FI-LICA updates was used.
However, there are some practical considerations that we are aware of for the replace0 method with the current LICA implementation. In the replace0 analysis, LICA can give unstable estimation (i.e., unstable and divergent dF), which is not desired. In addition, it can stop early especially when the missing data has a large percentage of missing. In cases where LICA stopped early, we reduced the starting iteration number (e.g., 1500) by 25% (round up to the nearest integer if the reduction does not give a whole number) and reran LICA until it worked.</p>

<p class="ltx_p" id="S4.SS1.p2.1">The data were downloaded from the ADNI database (<a class="ltx_ref ltx_url ltx_font_typewriter" href="http://adni.loni.usc.edu" title="">http://adni.loni.usc.edu</a>). The initial phase (ADNI-1) recruited 800 participants, including approximately 200 healthy controls, 400 patients with late MCI, and 200 patients clinically diagnosed with AD over 50 sites across the United States and Canada and followed up at 6- to 12-month intervals for 2-3 years. ADNI has been followed by ADNI-GO and ADNI-2 for existing participants and enrolled additional individuals, including early MCI. To be classified as MCI in ADNI, a subject needed an inclusive Mini-Mental State Examination score of between 24 and 30, subjective memory complaint, objective evidence of impaired memory calculated by scores of the Wechsler Memory Scale Logical Memory II adjusted for education, a score of 0.5 on the Global Clinical Dementia Rating, absence of significant confounding conditions such as current major depression, normal or near-normal daily activities, and absence of clinical dementia.
All studies were approved by their respective institutional review boards and all subjects or their surrogates provided informed consent compliant with HIPAA regulations.</p>

<p class="ltx_p" id="S4.SS1.p3.1">This analysis used three modalities – T1, AV45 PET, and FDG PET. Each PET modality was matched with one T1 data within one year of its scan date. Data with the earliest available PET scan was considered as baseline. We focused on 1291 subjects who had no missing in T1 but may have missing data in AV45 PET or FDG PET at baseline. We noticed that the two PET modalities might be matched with different T1 scans. To ensure that each subject had only one baseline measure, we took the earlier T1 data if the two T1 dates were within 6 months of each other, and if the two T1 dates were more than 6 months apart, we took the earlier T1 data along with its matched PET data and excluded the other pair of matched T1 and PET data.

Cross-sectional image processing was performed using FreeSurfer Version 7. Vertex-level cortical thickness was obtained from T1-weighted MR images on fsaverage5 space with 6mm FWHM smoothing. The preprocessed PET images were downloaded from the ADNI website. Either six five-minute frames (ADNI1) or four five-minute frames (ADNI GO/2) are acquired 30 to 60 minutes post-injection. Separate frames were extracted from the image file and co-registered to the first extracted frame of the raw image file (frame acquired at 30-35 min post-injection). The base frame image and the co-registered frames were recombined into a co-registered dynamic image set. The images were further processed using PET surfer <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Greve et al., <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2406.18829v1#bib.bib45" title="">2014</a>)</cite> with partial volume correction with 6mm extent, and the vertex-level data were sampled on fsaverage5 space with 6mm FWHM smoothing.

When focusing on the completers only, FI-LICA still performs slightly better than replace0, and they both outperform complete case analysis.
For the AD transition prediction of MCI participants, it can be observed that with the full sample size, FI-LICA performs better than replace0.
When focusing on the completers only, FI-LICA still has a better performance than replace0 and has a comparably good performance as the complete case analysis.</p>

<p class="ltx_p" id="S5.p1.10">In this paper, we proposed the Full Information Linked ICA algorithm (FI-LICA) to address the missing data problem during multimodal fusion, under the LICA framework.
We evaluated the performance of our algorithm, as well as two current practices, under two mechanisms of missing data – MCAR and MAR.
Our simulation results revealed that replacing missing with zero, one current practice of dealing with missing data in LICA, works fine if we are only interested in estimating the spatial maps <math alttext="\mathbf{X_{W}}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" id="S5.p1.1.m1.1"><semantics id="S5.p1.1.m1.1a"><msub id="S5.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S5.p1.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">𝐗</mi><mi id="S5.p1.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">𝐖</mi></msub><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.p1.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S5.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S5.p1.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S5.p1.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.1.1.2">𝐗</ci><ci id="S5.p1.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S5.p1.1.m1.1.1.3">𝐖</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.p1.1.m1.1c">\mathbf{X_{W}}</annotation><annotation encoding="application/x-llamapun" id="S5.p1.1.m1.1d">bold_X start_POSTSUBSCRIPT bold_W end_POSTSUBSCRIPT</annotation></semantics></math> and if the missing percentage is small, but it is not likely to perform well to estimate the latent space matrix <math alttext="\mathbf{H}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline" id="S5.p1.2.m2.1"><semantics id="S5.p1.2.m2.1a"><mi id="S5.p1.2.m2.1.1" xref="S5.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml">𝐇</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.p1.2.m2.1b"><ci id="S5.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.p1.2.m2.1.1">𝐇</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.p1.2.m2.1c">\mathbf{H}</annotation><annotation encoding="application/x-llamapun" id="S5.p1.2.m2.1d">bold_H</annotation></semantics></math> and use it for future analysis.
