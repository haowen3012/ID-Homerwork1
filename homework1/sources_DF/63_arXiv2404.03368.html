<p class="ltx_p" id="id3.id1"><span class="ltx_text" id="id3.id1.1">Pumped-storage hydropower plants (PSH) actively participate in grid power-frequency control and therefore often operate under dynamic conditions, which results in rapidly varying system states.
Predicting these dynamically changing states is essential for comprehending the underlying sensor and machine conditions. This understanding aids in detecting anomalies and faults, ensuring the reliable operation of the connected power grid, and in identifying faulty and miscalibrated sensors.
PSH are complex, highly interconnected systems encompassing electrical and hydraulic subsystems, each characterized by their respective underlying networks that can individually be represented as graph.
To take advantage of this relational inductive bias, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="id3.id1.1.1">graph neural networks</span> (GNNs) have been separately applied to state forecasting tasks in the individual subsystems, but without considering their interdependencies.
In PSH, however, these subsystems depend on the same control input, making their operations highly interdependent and interconnected.
Consequently, hydraulic and electrical sensor data should be fused across PSH subsystems to improve state forecasting accuracy.
This approach has not been explored in GNN literature yet because many available PSH graphs are limited to their respective subsystem boundaries, which makes the method unsuitable to be applied directly.
In this work, we introduce the application of <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="id3.id1.1.2">spectral-temporal graph neural networks</span>, which leverage self-attention mechanisms to concurrently capture and learn meaningful subsystem interdependencies and the
dynamic patterns observed in electric and hydraulic sensors.
Our method effectively fuses data from the PSH’s subsystems by operating on a unified, system-wide graph, learned directly from the data, This approach leads to demonstrably improved state forecasting performance and enhanced generalizability.</span></p>

<div class="ltx_para" id="S1.p1">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S1.p1.1">In power grids, pumped-storage hydropower plants (PSH) are well-established
for large-scale energy storage due to their efficiency, scalablilty and flexibility.
In this role, these plants dynamically respond to potentially large fluctuations in grid demand.
In the transition towards smart grids, PSH sensor data
is collected via <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S1.p1.1.1">wide area measurement systems (WAMS)</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">pagnierEmbeddingPowerFlow2021</span>]</cite> and is stored
in centralized <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S1.p1.1.2">energy management systems (EMS)</span>.
By processing the aggregated WAMS data,
modern EMS provide crucial functionalities for PSH operators
such as load forecasting,
real-time monitoring,
distribution and demand-side management,
and various decision support tools aimed at
increasing efficiency and sustainability.
To enhance system reliability, EMS implement anomaly and sensor fault detection
based on short-term forecasting and state estimation,
playing a pivotal role in preventing failures
that could lead to widespread power grid outages and significant economic losses.
However, the dynamic operation of the PSH
and the vast amounts of data transmitted by the WAMS
significantly complicate the task.
In the PSH environment, conventional state estimation
is often ineffective
because the computation can take several minutes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">liDynamicGraphBasedAnomaly2022</span>]</cite>.
This delay leads to a rapid divergence
between the most recent and the previously used system state
for the estimation,
resulting in numerous false-positives when applied to anomaly detection. Consequently, it becomes challenging to maintain a comprehensive overview
of the system’s health and performance.
As a solution, deep-learning-based short-term state forecasting has recently been applied,
which offers significantly faster processing times
and holds the potential to benefit from the additional data
increasingly collected at a high sampling rate <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">kundacinaStateEstimationElectric2022</span>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S1.p2">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S1.p2.1">Developing deep-learning-based state forecasting
for PSH is particularly challenging.
These challenges stem from the necessity to accurately represent
two distinct physical domains within the PSH: the hydraulic and electrical systems.
Although these domains are mechanically interconnected by electromagnetic generators, they are traditionally modeled independently in mechanical engineering.
This division mainly stems from the distinct dynamics governing each subsystem.
It is, therefore, challenging to model hydraulic and electrical domains simultaneously.
Nonetheless, considering the direct causal relationship between the systems – wherein kinetic energy is transformed to electric energy –
we hypothesize that fusing data from both subsystems, which operate under a unified control input, can significantly enhance state forecasting.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S1.p3">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S1.p3.1">To address the challenge of fusing electric and hydraulic data,
we posit that both subsystems of the PSH consist of extensive networks,
which are coarsely monitored with sensors
that can be represented in the non-Euclidean graph domain.
By operating on this more effective graph representation,
which can capture biases given by the PSH system architecture
and homophily biases,
addressing the phenomenon that sensor measurements tend to be connected with “similar” or “alike” others <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">maHomophilyNecessityGraph2023</span>]</cite>,
<span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S1.p3.1.1">graph neural networks</span> (GNNs) have recently gained significant attention.
When a graph is available, GNNs have been effectively applied in key applications
to (hydro) power plants <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">liaoReviewGraphNeural2022</span>]</cite>
and in the broader power grid environment.
However, these methods depend on the availability of apriori graphs,
derived from PSH’s electrical and hydraulic network diagrams.
Therefore, their applicability is limited by the fact that,
although the underlying network structure
of both electric and hydraulic subsystems of a PSH can be modeled as a graph,
network diagrams for PSH exist typically only separately for each subsystem.
Consequently, most graph-based methods are confined
within the boundaries of their respective systems.
To overcome this limitation,
we propose learning a PSH sensor graph
from latent dependencies in the data.
While it has previously been demonstrated that graph structures
can be efficiently learned from data,
this approach remains unexplored in the context of hydropower plants.
In light of this, inspired by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">caoSpectralTemporalGraph2021</span>]</cite>,
we propose using <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S1.p3.1.2">spectral-temporal graph neural networks</span> (STGNN) to learn a latent correlation graph structure across the entire PSH asset
for the fusion of electric and hydraulic data, leveraging the self-attention mechanism.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S1.p4">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S1.p4.1">Compared to numerical simulation, our data-driven GNN-based methodology is computationally inexpensive
and does not require expert knowledge while maintaining interpretability, due to the accessibility of the learned graph.
Our proposed approach can be easily transferred to different PSH assets without any calibration.
To the best of our knowledge, there is no other work
on data-driven electric and hydraulic data fusion for PSH using graph neural networks.</p>

<p class="ltx_p" id="S1.p5.1">To summarize, in this work, we introduce the application of attention-based graph neural networks to effectively learn intra- and interdependencies
between the subsystems’ sensors to enhance the short-term state forecast in the pumped
storage power plant (PSH) environment.

To the best of our knowledge,
the approach of employing a self-attention mechanism
at the graph level to learn a graph structure that
integrates electrical and hydraulic data using <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S2.p2.1.1">graph neural networks</span>
has not yet been addressed in previous research.</p>

<p class="ltx_p" id="S2.p3.1">In the context of power systems, data fusion represents a crucial technique for enhancing the accuracy and reliability of forecasting algorithms by integrating diverse data sources.
In the electrical domain, the fusion of diverse electrical system information
was utilized to estimate the voltage in distribution networks
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">zhuCrossDomainDataFusion2020</span>]</cite>, using cross-correlations between individual transformers.
Another research study achieved state-of-the-art
multi-site photovoltaic (PV) power forecasting
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">simeunovicSpatioTemporalGraphNeural2022</span>]</cite>,
fusing spatially distributed PV data by
exploiting the intuition that PV systems provide a dense network of virtual weather stations.
Integrating weather station data was also explored for anomaly detection
for the industrial internet of things
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">wuGraphNeuralNetworks2022</span>]</cite>.
Given its importance, modeling the interaction between the PSH subsystems
has previously been explored using higher-order numerical simulation (SIMSEN) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">simondSimulationToolLinking2006</span>]</cite>.
However, operating numerical simulators in practice
requires precise calibration
and, consequently, extensive documentation of the components, which is typically not readily available.
This calibration step is indispensable due to the components exhibiting highly non-linear characteristics
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">nicoletHighOrderModelingHydraulic2007</span>]</cite>.
Given the significant variations in designs across different PSH assets, and the necessity for
expert knowledge (which is often unavailable), applying this simulator-based methodology is often infeasible in real-world applications.
For PSH, these limitations shift the focus to data-driven interaction modelling with GNNs, which is computationally affordable and does not necessitate expert knowledge, yet remains unexplored.</p>

we decompose the forecasting problem into learning
the underlying latent graph structure from time series data (Sec. <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2404.03368v1#S3.SS4" title="3.4 Attention-based Graph Learning ‣ 3 Methodology ‣ Graph Neural Networks for Electric and Hydraulic Data Fusion to Enhance Short-term Forecasting of Pumped-storage Hydroelectricity"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3.4</span></a>).
Subsequently, on the learned graph, we introduce
graph-spectral and time-spectral filtering (Sec. <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2404.03368v1#S3.SS6" title="3.6 Graph- and Time-spectral Filtering ‣ 3 Methodology ‣ Graph Neural Networks for Electric and Hydraulic Data Fusion to Enhance Short-term Forecasting of Pumped-storage Hydroelectricity"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3.6</span></a>).

by mapping the input data
from the spatial-temporal vertex domain of the sensor signals
to a spectral latent representation.
This mapping is achieved through the sequential application of graph-spectral
and time-spectral transformations, as introduced in Sec. <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2404.03368v1#S3.SS6" title="3.6 Graph- and Time-spectral Filtering ‣ 3 Methodology ‣ Graph Neural Networks for Electric and Hydraulic Data Fusion to Enhance Short-term Forecasting of Pumped-storage Hydroelectricity"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3.6</span></a>.
The corresponding inverse transformations are utilized to reconstruct
the sensor signal in the spatial-temporal domain.
To address the problem of vanishing gradients and performance degradation with increasing network depth, we introduce skip connections to compute the final forecast.

<p class="ltx_p" id="S4.p1.1">The dataset in this case study was obtained in collaboration with the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB).
SBB maintains a separate railway traction current network (RTN)
that operates at a frequency of 16.66 Hz to power rolling stock across Switzerland.
The power plant operators of SBB use <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S4.p1.1.1">supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA)</span> protocols to transmit sensor data
to a centralized <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S4.p1.1.2">energy management system</span> (EMS). This setup allows for real-time

ensuring timeliness and synchronicity between sensor signals,

From an operator’s perspective, forecasting currents is particularly compelling when dealing with rolling stock, given their highly dynamic current profile
that is vastly different to residential power grids.
While the residential sub-grid of Zurich, the largest City of Switzerland, is subject
to transient load changes within 15 minutes intervals of up to 35MW,
the RTN of SBB experiences load changes up to 250 MW whithin the same time interval due to the orchestrated and periodic timetable of the Swiss railway network <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">halderPowerDemandManagement2018</span>]</cite>.
The importance of accurate current forecasts is additionally heightened
because electrical components in power systems,
like transformers and conductors,
have thermal limitations that depend on the amount of current flowing through them.
Unlike voltage levels, current levels in the PSH dynamically react to transient loads changes.
Anomalies such as sudden increases or decreases in power demand,
or failures in equipment, are therefore more immediately reflected in current fluctuations.
We therefore focus on phasor current forecasting in this study.</p>

<p class="ltx_p" id="S5.p3.1">For the evaluation of A3-GCN,

into a processable graph, as having apriori graph
is a computational requirement for the method.
Surprisingly, we found that the A3-GCN is outperformed

This finding highlights that the intuitive approach of applying
GNN directly to a graph derived from schematic diagrams,
does not always yield acceptable results.
In this context, since our proposed STGNN is also based on GCN,
the 34.7% improvement in NMSE illustrates that, beyond choosing the right model,
finding a suitable computational graph is crucial for processing PSH data.
Our results provide further support
for the observation in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">ringsquandlPowerRelationalInductive2021</span>]</cite>
that statistical properties
of graphs derived from network diagrams of power grids
may be unsuitable for direct graph processing.
Graphs derived from such network diagrams significantly differ from those typically discussed in the graph-theoretical literature, with statistical properties like
lower clustering-coefficients,
lower node degrees,
and higher graph diameters,
which could explain the subpar performance of A3-GCN
in the state forecasting task.
From a message-passing perspective,
the specific properties of these graphs hinder effective message propagation unless the GNN comprises many layers.
Unfortunaltely, this model choice, in turn, significantly boosts
oversmoothing, which is already a prevalent challenge in the power grid environment
due to the high similarity of the electrical sensor data.</p>

over the test data set.
We expect our method to converge to the same graph
for randomized training initialization
when learning physical relationships between the sensors.
To verify our expectation, we visually compare the average attention
across random seeds in Figure <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2404.03368v1#S5.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ 5 Results ‣ Graph Neural Networks for Electric and Hydraulic Data Fusion to Enhance Short-term Forecasting of Pumped-storage Hydroelectricity"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>.
Additionally, our analysis reveals that the inferred attention graph’s minimal parameterization
yields temporally stable graphs,
accurately reflecting the situation in the PSH,
which usually has stable topology across time.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S5.p6">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S5.p6.1">Interestingly, the attention graph recovers casual relations given by the functioning
of the hydropower plant and therefore shows similarity to
the underlying physical network of the hydropower plant.
In Figure <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2404.03368v1#S5.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ 5 Results ‣ Graph Neural Networks for Electric and Hydraulic Data Fusion to Enhance Short-term Forecasting of Pumped-storage Hydroelectricity"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>, we depict the relationships between
the water inflow (flow-rates, pressures),
the generator units (groups and transformers, indicated by TRF),
and the PSH outlets (substations, denoted by SP),
overall making the model’s predictions more interpretable.
Leveraging this interpretability,
we compare Figures <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2404.03368v1#S5.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ 5 Results ‣ Graph Neural Networks for Electric and Hydraulic Data Fusion to Enhance Short-term Forecasting of Pumped-storage Hydroelectricity"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a> and <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2404.03368v1#S5.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ 5 Results ‣ Graph Neural Networks for Electric and Hydraulic Data Fusion to Enhance Short-term Forecasting of Pumped-storage Hydroelectricity"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>.
Surprisingly, our model focuses on the PSH outlets to predict the power plant
input’s phasor currents in the absence of hydraulic information from the forecast,
which could explain the more severe outliers in the forecast (Figure <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2404.03368v1#S5.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ 5 Results ‣ Graph Neural Networks for Electric and Hydraulic Data Fusion to Enhance Short-term Forecasting of Pumped-storage Hydroelectricity"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>).
When adding hydraulic information to the forecast, we observe that the model
makes additional use of penstock flow-rate and pressure sensor data,

<div class="ltx_para" id="S6.p1">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S6.p1.1">In this paper, we demonstrate that integrating information across the electrical and hydraulic subsystems is beneficial for state forecasting in pumped-storage hydropower plants (PSH).
Our proposed <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S6.p1.1.1">spectral-temporal graph neural network</span>
is the first approach to integrate information across
the PSH’s subsystems by applying <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S6.p1.1.2">attention-based graph learning</span>, which
effectively represents PSH states
for short-term phasor current forecasting.
Compared to numerical simulation,
our method requires neither knowledge of the underlying
network and sensor connectivity graph
nor a tedious calibration step.
Through a real world case study,
we demonstrate that relying exclusively on graphs derived from network diagrams for state forecasting does not always yield the best performance.
We highlight the advantages of learning a PSH-wide graph, complementing the critical perspective
on network-diagram-derived graphs
introduced in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">ringsquandlPowerRelationalInductive2021</span>]</cite>.
Moreover, we show that our method remains interpretable,
unlike other deep-learning methods
that process electrical and hydraulic data simultaneously.
Future work looks to reintegrate the underlying network diagram
while maintaining the flexibility of attention-based graph learning,
thereby harnessing the strengths of both approaches.
This could also allow for the incorporation of physics-informed losses, such as electromagnetic
generator efficiency or power flow,
which may reduce the volume
of training data required.</p>
