We propose, for the first time, a principled architecture which employs Variational Auto-Encoders for estimating a latent distribution responsible for generating the data, and Evidential Deep Learning for its ability to sense out-of-distribution activities.
We verify that the fused data processed by different antennas of the same Wi-Fi receiver results in increased accuracy of human activity recognition compared with the most recent benchmarks, while still being informative when facing out-of-distribution samples and enabling semantic interpretation of latent variables in terms of physical phenomena.
The results of this paper are a first contribution toward the ultimate goal of providing a flexible, semantic characterisation of black-swan events, <span class="ltx_ERROR undefined" id="id9.id1.2.1">\ie</span>events for which we have limited to no training data.</span></p>

Specifically, we focus on the scenario illustrated in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2407.04733v1#bib.bib3" title="">3</a>]</cite>, where a commercial <span class="ltx_text" id="S2.SS1.p1.1.2">Wi-Fi</span> receiver is used to <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S2.SS1.p1.1.3">sense</span> the environment through the analysis of the <span class="ltx_glossaryref" title="">CSI</span> and detect specific activities performed by an unspecified person inside a room.</p>

<p class="ltx_p" id="S2.SS1.p2.1">In wireless communications, the <span class="ltx_glossaryref" title="">CSI</span> is an estimation of the wireless channel’s properties (see <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2407.04733v1#S2.F1" title="In II-A Motivating Scenario ‣ II Background ‣ Accurate Passive Radar via an Uncertainty-Aware Fusion of Wi-Fi Sensing Data Thanks to Erik Blasch for participating in the project.

The <span class="ltx_glossaryref" title="">CSI</span> is a critical element in <span class="ltx_glossaryref" title="">orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)</span> communication systems (including <span class="ltx_text" id="S2.SS1.p2.1.2">Wi-Fi</span>) because it allows equalising frequency-selective distortions on wide-band communication channels by simply comparing symbols received in the frames’ preamble against a known reference signal <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2407.04733v1#bib.bib7" title="">7</a>]</cite>.
Since such distortions are directly related to the <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S2.SS1.p2.1.3">multipath</span> effect caused by the physical environment, <span class="ltx_glossaryref" title="">CSI</span> analysis is essential for many <span class="ltx_text" id="S2.SS1.p2.1.4">Wi-Fi</span> sensing applications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2407.04733v1#bib.bib8" title="">8</a>]</cite>.
Indeed, the electromagnetic interaction of the wireless signals with the surrounding environment is captured by the <span class="ltx_glossaryref" title="">CSI</span> in the form of idiosyncratic interference patterns that depend on the room geometry, the furniture layout, and even the presence and the movements of human bodies.
In other words, the <span class="ltx_glossaryref" title="">CSI</span> can be interpreted as an electromagnetic fingerprint of the environment, and <span class="ltx_text" id="S2.SS1.p2.1.5">Wi-Fi</span> receivers can be considered under appropriate assumptions as passive radars.</p>

<p class="ltx_p" id="S2.SS1.p3.1">In this work, we rely on a <span class="ltx_glossaryref" title="">CSI</span> dataset recently published for <span class="ltx_glossaryref" title="">HAR</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2407.04733v1#bib.bib3" title="">3</a>]</cite>.
The testbed consists of two Asus RT-AX86U routers, each of which has four antennas and has <span class="ltx_glossaryref" title="">multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)</span> capabilities.
During the experiments, one router generates dummy <span class="ltx_text" id="S2.SS1.p3.1.1">Wi-Fi</span> traffic at a constant rate of 150 frames per second using the injection feature of AX-CSI <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2407.04733v1#bib.bib9" title="">9</a>]</cite>, while the other router (also called <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S2.SS1.p3.1.2">monitor</span>) uses the same software tool to do the <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S2.SS1.p3.1.3">sensing</span>, <span class="ltx_ERROR undefined" id="S2.SS1.p3.1.4">\ie</span>to collect the <span class="ltx_glossaryref" title="">CSI</span> from the received test <span class="ltx_text" id="S2.SS1.p3.1.5">Wi-Fi</span> frames.

As the person walks around the room, the effect of the environment on the signal changes due to the varying scattering on the human body.
The result is captured in a sort of <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic" id="S2.SS1.p4.1.2">spectrogram</em> that highlights how the relative intensity of the signal changes over time and frequency.
The fundamental assumption of <span class="ltx_glossaryref" title="">CSI</span>-based <span class="ltx_glossaryref" title="">HAR</span> is that it is possible to trace these variations back to the human activity that caused them.
Currently, state-of-the-art <span class="ltx_glossaryref" title="">HAR</span> systems work by deriving some physically-related quantity from the <span class="ltx_glossaryref" title="">CSI</span> that is then used to train a deep learning classification system, like in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2407.04733v1#bib.bib10" title="">10</a>, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2407.04733v1#bib.bib11" title="">11</a>, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2407.04733v1#bib.bib12" title="">12</a>]</cite>.</p>

However, we find at least three points that separate our work from the current state of the art.
First, our work builds upon <span class="ltx_glossaryref" title="">CSI</span> measurements made with commercial <span class="ltx_text" id="S2.SS1.p5.1.2">Wi-Fi</span> systems, while <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2407.04733v1#bib.bib4" title="">4</a>]</cite> employs custom hardware integrated with a <span class="ltx_glossaryref" title="">software-defined radio (SDR)</span> platform.
Second, by using an <span class="ltx_glossaryref" title="">EDL</span> loss function our approach can handle <span class="ltx_glossaryref" title="">OoD</span> samples.
Finally, the causal assumptions behind the <span class="ltx_glossaryref" title="">VAE</span>-based architecture allow us to (post-hoc) explain the variables in the latent space in terms of physical quantities.</p>

For <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_sansserif" id="S3.SS1.p6.1.7">VAE-F</span> instead, we stack the <span class="ltx_glossaryref" title="">CSI</span> of the four antennas along a third dimension, in a way that can be analogously interpreted as four separate channels of a single image.
It is important to notice that this is not the <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="S3.SS1.p6.1.8">best</span> solution for processing the <span class="ltx_glossaryref" title="">CSI</span>; on the contrary, we are deliberately removing some of the information.

Since the four antennas of the monitor are spaced by more than half wavelength, the received signals are generally deemed uncorrelated due to the multipath effects.
Hence, there should not be a real advantage in using a single <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_sansserif" id="S3.SS2.p4.1.7">Early-Fusing</span> architecture.
Instead, from an engineering perspective, it is arguably easier to employ four antenna-specific <span class="ltx_glossaryref" title="">VAEs</span> rather than trying to extract information from a tensor with four orthogonal components.</p>

We notice that even if the <span class="ltx_glossaryref" title="">VAE</span> operates unsupervised, without any notion of the semantics behind the <span class="ltx_glossaryref" title="">CSI</span>, it is capable of separating clusters of <span class="ltx_glossaryref" title="">CSI</span> data corresponding to different activities.
It is interesting to observe the overlap between the classes <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic" id="S4.SS1.p2.4.3">run</em> and <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic" id="S4.SS1.p2.4.4">walk</em>, with the former that looks like a subset of the latter.
In addition, we observe a partial overlap between classes that share some commonalities, such as <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic" id="S4.SS1.p2.4.5">run</em> and <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic" id="S4.SS1.p2.4.6">jump</em>, or <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic" id="S4.SS1.p2.4.7">sit</em> and <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic" id="S4.SS1.p2.4.8">empty room</em>.</p>
