<p class="ltx_p" id="id12.id1">The field of medical diagnostics has witnessed a transformative convergence of artificial intelligence (AI) and healthcare data, offering promising avenues for enhancing patient care and disease comprehension. However, this integration of multimodal data, specifically histopathology whole slide images (WSIs) and genetic sequencing data, presents unique challenges due to modality disparities and the need for scalable computational solutions. This paper addresses the scarcity of multimodal solutions, primarily centered around unimodal data solutions, thus limiting the realization of the rich insights that can be derived from integrating images and genomic data. Here, we introduce MarbliX “Multimodal Association and Retrieval with Binary Latent Indexed matriX,” an innovative multimodal framework that integrates histopathology images with immunogenomic sequencing data, encapsulating them into a concise binary patient code, referred to as “monogram.” This binary representation facilitates the establishment of a comprehensive archive, enabling clinicians to match similar cases. The experimental results demonstrate the potential of MarbliX to empower healthcare professionals with in-depth insights, leading to more precise diagnoses, reduced variability, and expanded personalized treatment options, particularly in the context of cancer.</p>

<div class="ltx_para" id="S1.p1">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S1.p1.1">The traditional diagnosis of cancer primarily relies on the microscopic examination of tissue slides. However, over recent decades, the diagnostic process has undergone a transformation with the integration of molecular tests. This evolution has led to more precise grading and prognosis for cancer patients. While molecular assays have made remarkable strides in various aspects, the intricate task of assessing tissue morphology still falls within the realm of skilled pathologists. The landscape of cancer diagnosis is currently experiencing a rapid shift, largely driven by the advent of digital pathology. Machine learning techniques have the potential to revolutionize the clinical workflow. While traditional approaches may focus solely on morphological features in histopathology whole slide images (WSIs) when studying tumors in a given sample case, recent advancements in machine learning techniques have expanded our ability to extract valuable insights from complex molecular data. Generally, relying solely on morphological features to understand cancer may provide an incomplete picture. However, with the advent of deep learning, researchers have gained the ability to delve deeper into the molecular and genetic aspects of cancer. For instance, deep learning models can analyze extensive biological sequence databases, uncovering intricate patterns and associations that might have been overlooked using conventional methods.</p>

<p class="ltx_p" id="S1.p3.1">The integration of diverse data streams derived from various sources provides pathologists and clinicians with a holistic perspective on cancer’s complex manifestations. Each modality illuminates unique facets of tumor biology, collectively offering crucial insights into a patient’s prognosis and treatment options. However, the inherently high-dimensional nature of some of most of the clinical data modalities poses a formidable challenge for manual interpretation, making it arduous for clinicians to extract meaningful information from these multimodal biomedical datasets in order to guide treatment decisions and estimate prognosis. Patient heterogeneity further underscores the need for personalized tumor characterization to optimize treatment strategies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2409.13115v1#bib.bib13" title="">13</a>]</cite>. Leveraging machine learning and deep learning tools to uncover hidden patterns within multimodal data is pivotal in constructing robust models capable of more accurately gauging tumor aggressiveness and predicting treatment outcomes. Despite the availability of multimodal data, their integration into a cohesive computerized framework remains rare; most current automated solutions are tailored to a single data modality. This underscores the untapped potential for harnessing the synergy of diverse data sources in cancer diagnosis and treatment planning.</p>

<div class="ltx_para" id="S1.p4">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S1.p4.1">In this paper, we introduce a novel multimodal framework known as Multimodal Association and Retrieval with Binary Latent Indexed matriX (MarbliX). The absence of any pre-existing multimodal AI solutions that incorporate both histopathology and immunogenomic data serves as a compelling incentive to introduce MarbliX to unveiling the underlying latent correlations between these complex yet informative modalities. MarbliX (<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2409.13115v1#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Personalized 2D Binary Patient Codes of Tissue Images and Immunogenomic Data Through Multimodal Self-Supervised Fusion"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>) is an innovative framework harnesses the capabilities of deep learning to merge histopathology whole slide images (WSIs) with immune cell sequencing data, condensing them into a concise binary patient code referred to as “monogram.” This compact binary representation encapsulates the intricate patterns found within extensive multimodal data files, encompassing both histopathology images and genomic data. Moreover, MarbliX serves as an efficient similarity search tool for establishing a comprehensive “monogram”-based archive. It enables the matching and retrieval of similar cases to a given query case, thus empowering clinicians and pathologists with an in-depth comprehension of cases. Current search solutions for histopathology entirely focus on whole slides images and their patches <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2409.13115v1#bib.bib14" title="">14</a>, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2409.13115v1#bib.bib15" title="">15</a>, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2409.13115v1#bib.bib16" title="">16</a>]</cite>.This facilitates more precise and timely diagnoses, reduces variability in assessments, and augments personalized treatment options.</p>

<p class="ltx_p" id="S2.p1.1">MarbliX framework is designed with the purpose of fusing the subtle morphological characteristics found in histopathology images with the intricate immune response patterns within immune cell sequencing profiles. The underlying rationale for this choice is deeply rooted in the profound clinical implications of these modalities. Histopathology data, with its potentials to unveil the subtleties of tissue structures, and immune cell sequencing data, capable of unraveling the molecular nuances of immune responses.</p>

Only cases featuring both WSI and genomic profiles were considered. This resulted in a dataset comprising 535 lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) cases and 510 lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) cases for the lung primary site. For the kidney primary site, the dataset consisted of three classes: 508 kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC) cases, 248 kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma (KIRP) cases, and 38 kidney chromophobe (KICH) cases. MarbliX was evaluated using 5-fold cross validation for lung dataset while 2-fold cross validation was used to evaluate kidney dataset due to the limited number of cases in the KICH subtype as enough cases from every subtype is needed for meaningful training.</p>

<div class="ltx_para" id="S2.SSx1.p1">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S2.SSx1.p1.1">Different experiments were conducted to evaluate the quality of the patient representation. An experiment was performed to analyze the quality of the multimodal latent association applied through the hybrid autoencoders to map histopathology features to immunogenomic features, and vice versa. As shown in Figure <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2409.13115v1#S2.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 2 Results ‣ Personalized 2D Binary Patient Codes of Tissue Images and Immunogenomic Data Through Multimodal Self-Supervised Fusion"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>, the cosine similarity was calculated between every histopathology and immunogenomic embedding extracted by the pretrained model with the reconstructed histopathology and immunogenomic, respectively, embeddings by the trained hybrid autoencoders. The violin plots in Figure <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2409.13115v1#S2.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 2 Results ‣ Personalized 2D Binary Patient Codes of Tissue Images and Immunogenomic Data Through Multimodal Self-Supervised Fusion"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a> show the distribution of the cosine similarities between the original embedding and the reconstructed embedding of every case in the test sets of (a) lung dataset and (b) kidney dataset. The median cosine similarities of 0.95 for lung histopathology and 0.91 for kidney histopathology indicate a strong overall resemblance between the original and reconstructed embeddings, suggesting effective feature retention. Similarly, in the immunogenomic distribution, with median cosine similarities of 0.93 for lung and 0.94 for kidney, the model maintains a high degree of similarity on average during the reconstruction process. The tightly packed quartiles in both lung and kidney histopathology plots imply consistent performance across the majority of cases. However, the wider spread in the upper quartile of the immunogenomic kidney plot suggests challenges in accurately reconstructing complex patterns, potentially attributed to the limited representation of the KICH subtype in the training set. This limitation may lead to deviations in reconstructions when confronted with new, less familiar patterns in the test set.</p>

Remarkably, the MSE values exhibit consistency across both histopathology and immunogenomics reconstructions, ranging between 0.020 and 0.030 for both datasets. The MSE values indicate that the model performs well in minimizing the squared differences between the original and reconstructed embeddings, reaffirming the reliability of the reconstruction process for both histopathological and immunogenomic features in the lung and kidney datasets.</p>

The curves represent the evolution of the loss function over training epochs for each model. Initially, both models exhibit a sharp decrease in the loss, indicative of effective learning and convergence tendency. However, as the epochs progress, subtle differences emerge. The model trained on the kidney dataset demonstrates a slightly more gradual decline in the loss compared to its lung counterpart. This might suggest that the kidney dataset poses greater complexity or variability, requiring the model to adapt more cautiously.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S2.SSx1.p4">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S2.SSx1.p4.1">The binary monograms generated by MarbliX were analyzed to assess both inter and intra-dissimilarity between the representations. To address the limited number of KICH cases, a set of 19 random cases was selected from the test set of each subtype. Quantifying the dissimilarity between matrices involved performing a bitwise XOR operation to identify differing bits between any two matrices. The resulting heatmap, displaying calculated dissimilarities, is presented in <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2409.13115v1#S2.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 2 Results ‣ Personalized 2D Binary Patient Codes of Tissue Images and Immunogenomic Data Through Multimodal Self-Supervised Fusion"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a> (d). Notably, the heatmap’s diagonal reflects the smallest dissimilarity, indicating that MarbliX generates similar representations for patients with shared diagnoses. However, intra-dissimilarity among patient representations within LUAD, LUSC, and KIRC was observed to be lower compared to the intra-dissimilarity within KIRP and KICH. This can be attributed to the limited number of cases in the latter two subtypes, leading to constrained coverage of subtype features during the training process. Furthermore, the heatmap illustrates that KIRP and KICH shows a lower degree of dissimilarity in their representations than the dissimilarity observed between either of them and KIRC. This could stem from more common patterns between KIRP and KICH or, alternatively, the limited available cases belonging to KIRP and KICH during training. The dissimilarity between lung monograms (LUAD and LUSC) was smaller than the dissimilarity between lung monograms and kidney monograms (KIRC, KIRP, and KICH). Similarly, the dissimilarity between representations of kidney cases was smaller than the dissimilarity between kidney and lung cases. Additionally, the dissimilarity between representations of kidney subtypes was higher than the dissimilarity between representations of lung subtypes.</p>

The process begins with specimen collection for histopathology staining and genomics analysis. In the second stage, the tissue slide is digitized, and RNA sequencing is conducted to obtain the patient’s whole slide image and genomics profile, respectively. In the third stage, following unimodal transformations of the histopathology image and genomics profile, MarbliX integrates the two modalities into a binary multimodal representation, referred to as “monogram”. The final stage involves a multimodal search using the generated monogram as a query to identify the top n (in this case, n=3) similar matrices in the archive. The search is performed through Hamming distance comparison. The retrieved matrices can be utilized to identify the similar patients’ medical information, including histopathology images, genomics data, treatment history, and risk stratification.</figcaption>

The mean precision and mean recall of the folds are represented with the diamond shape, while the standard deviation of each mean value is shown as a horizontal bar. As shown in the figure, MarbliX representation maintains more stable results across the folds (different test sets) compared to the unimodal representations. This is evident from the generally shorter standard deviation bars for both lung and kidney results, indicating a more consistent performance. Furthermore, MarbliX maintains higher precision and recall compared to both lung histopathology and immunogenomic representations. For the kidney dataset, although the histopathology representation achieved the highest precision when a top-5 and top-10 majority vote was applied (90%-91%), it also achieved the lowest recall for the same measures (56%-59%). Binary MarbliX representation resulted in approximately the same recall as immunogenomics over the top-1 measure but demonstrated higher precision. Overall, MarbliX consistently maintained precision and recall above 78% for top-1, MV@3, MV@5, and MV@10 measures.</p>

<h2 class="ltx_title ltx_title_section">
<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">3 </span>Discussion</h2>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S3.p1">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S3.p1.1">The motivation for this research work stems from the significant challenges and unexplored opportunities that arise due to the conspicuous scarcity of multimodal solutions adept at merging histopathology images with genetic sequencing data in general, and with immunogenomic data in particular. Furthermore, as far as knowledge extends, the fusion of histopathology images with immunogenomic data remains an untapped area. By fusing these data modalities within the MarbliX framework, the objective is to effectively bridge critical research gaps and contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of cancer cases, while also unlocking new avenues for potential research in this domain. The work at hand brings forth four substantial contributions to the burgeoning field of multimodal research.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S3.p2">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S3.p2.1">First and foremost, MarbliX introduces a novel approach that condenses diverse data modalities into a concise representation, referred to as <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic" id="S3.p2.1.1">monogram</em>. This innovative concept enables the generation of <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic" id="S3.p2.1.2">monogram</em> for each individual patient, serving as a tangible representation of their multimodal data. This representation encapsulates the intricate patterns unearthed from various data sources, thereby affording each patient a highly informative imprint or signature. This approach empowers researchers and medical practitioners to extract rich insights from a patient’s multimodal clinical data, facilitating personalized and data-driven healthcare.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S3.p3">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S3.p3.1">The second contribution of MarbliX lies in its ability to create a binary barcode of multimodal patient data, which often comprises voluminous files like histopathology whole slide images (WSIs) and genetic sequencing data. This compactness holds profound implications for time efficiency, computational complexity, and storage requirements. Employing <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic" id="S3.p3.1.1">monograms</em> in diverse downstream tasks such as search and retrieval not only streamlines these operations but also unlocks a powerful tool that can handle data in varying formats, sizes, complexities, and sources.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S3.p4">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S3.p4.1">Furthermore, the third significant contribution of MarbliX is its backbone independence, a feature that distinguishes it as a versatile multimodal AI framework. The capability to map different modalities within a latent space not only contributes to the model’s training efficiency but also enables the extraction of associated patterns from data modalities originating from diverse sources within the medical field. This adaptability is paramount for addressing the heterogeneous nature of medical data.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S3.p5">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S3.p5.1">Lastly, but no less important, MarbliX serves as a valuable asset in facilitating multimodal search, a crucial task in medical research and diagnosis. With the ability to construct a monogram-indexed archives, MarbliX empowers practitioners with an interactive tool to multimodal search for cases similar to a given query. This process involves generating a monogram for the query case and then scouring the archive to retrieve the most analogous monograms that share similar patterns with the query. This feature enhances the discoverability of relevant cases and expedites the decision-making process in healthcare.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S3.p6">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S3.p6.1">The evaluation of MarbliX has demonstrated its remarkable success in capturing multimodal patient representations by integrating histopathology images and immunogenomic data to generate <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic" id="S3.p6.1.1">monogram</em> representations. These monograms serve as condensed binary representations of patients’ multimodal features, achieved through unimodal processing and transformation, multimodal latent association by training hybrid autoencoders, and self-supervised training with triplet loss. The assessment of patient representation demonstrated the efficacy of MarbliX in capturing distinctive features from both histopathology and immunogenomics modalities.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S3.p7">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S3.p7.1">The similarity analysis of generated monograms showed intra-similarity for patients with the same primary diagnosis and inter-dissimilarity between those with different primary diagnoses. Both visual and statistical analyses underscored MarbliX’s capability to generate meaningful compact binary barcodes, effectively discriminating between patients with distinct primary diagnoses. Furthermore, the evaluation of MarbliX in multimodal search and retrieval demonstrated its superiority over unimodal representations. Monograms consistently resulted in accurate and similar retrieved cases across various criteria, highlighting the model’s capability in capturing informative patterns from both histopathology and immunogenomic data. The t-SNE maps provided visual insights into MarbliX’s ability to create discriminative representations, notably enhancing the separation of cancer subtypes.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S3.p8">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S3.p8.1">In summary, MarbliX has effectively achieved its objectives by generating informative multimodal monograms that capture and represent the complex features of patients with different cancer subtypes. Beyond demonstrating its robustness in patient representation through multimodal search, MarbliX emerges as a versatile framework with applications extending beyond search and retrieval. Its capability to efficiently integrate and encapsulate distinct data modalities, each inherently possessing large sizes and complexity, into a compact binary matrix is remarkable. This resulting binary matrix serves as a powerful bridge between different modalities, with each entry encoding whether specific features from one modality align with or correspond to certain features in the other. The binary nature of the representations simplifies storage requirements and computational complexity needed for various applications. Multimodal data fusion through MarbliX paves the way for more informed and data-driven decision-making in complex biomedical analyses.</p>

Rare sequences and artifacts were filtered out by excluding those that were not common to a sufficient proportion of patients within each subtype class. Through experimentation, for the lung dataset, sequences that were not common to at least 30% of the patients within the subtype class were excluded, while a lower threshold of 15% was applied to kidney cases due to the limited number of samples. Before we encode the sequencing data into a dense vector, we applied <span class="ltx_text" id="S4.SS0.SSSx1.p4.6.2" style="color:#0000FF;">Seqwash <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2409.13115v1#bib.bib21" title="">21</a>]</cite></span> method to preprocess the sequencing profiles and prepare them for feature extraction. Seqwash is a “harmonization” approach tailored to genetic sequencing data and serves as a crucial preprocessing step, aimed at preparing these sequences for analysis using deep models designed for textual data by overcoming the impact of the variability among patients in terms of sequence lengths and unregulated sequence orders. Therefore, Seqwash was used to unify the patient profiles by aligning them into a standardized representation before proceeding with deep feature extraction.

However, as these embeddings come from different models, they have different ranges. Therefore, min-max rescaling was performed to bring the embeddings to a common scale before learning the association between them. After normalization, association learning was performed by projecting the two embeddings into a shared latent space. In this shared space, the embeddings from both modalities coalesce to form a concise patient representation. This step addresses the issue of non-relevant features that may exist in the uni-modal data obtained from a pretrained network. By merging these embeddings into an encoded representation, we want to extract and consolidate the pertinent features from each modality, enhancing their combined synergy and informative value in subsequent analyses.</p>

This step addresses the issue of non-relevant features that may exist in the uni-modal data obtained from a pretrained network. By merging these embeddings into an encoded representation, we want to extract and consolidate the pertinent features from each modality, enhancing their combined synergy and informative value in subsequent analyses. This is achieved by training the two hybrid models to generate an encoded latent representation, highlighting the relevant features. Specifically, each autoencoder model is designed to take one modality and reconstruct the other, resulting in a latent representation that embodies the dominant features of its respective modality.</p>

This process aims to unveil the underlying structure that interlinks histopathological characteristics with immune cell behavior among cases within the same diagnostic class. In other words, the model is engineered to capture the commonality in multimodal relationships among cases that share similar diagnoses, embedding these features within their respective <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic" id="S4.SS0.SSSx3.p2.1.1">monograms</em>. Simultaneously, it strives to discern the distinctions between cases of different diagnostic classes and accentuate these disparities within their corresponding monograms. This is achieved by employing self-supervised training using triplet loss to minimize the distance between patients with the same primary diagnosis and maximize the distance between patients with different primary diagnoses.</p>

The anchor case serves as the reference for which the model endeavors to generate a representative monogram. The positive case shares the same diagnosis as the anchor, reinforcing common features. In contrast, the negative case differs in diagnosis from the anchor, shedding light on the discrepancies between diagnostic classes. The positive and negative samples were selected for each anchor sample by calculating pairwise Euclidean distances and identifying the farthest positive sample and the closest negative sample for each anchor. This approach was implemented to ensure robust training by introducing hard triplets to the model, guiding toward learning the similarities between samples belonging to the same class, despite eventual dissimilarity between them. Analogously, this approach guides the model to generate different representations for cases that share common features in their data but belong to different classes.</p>
